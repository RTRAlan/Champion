              Baron Yarborough has joined the Birmingham Fastener family of
              companies as the General Manager of Champion Manufacturing.
              Champion, a rubber gasket manufacturer in the greater Houston
              area, was recently acquired by Birmingham Fastener, one of the
              nation’s most prominent fastener manufacturers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yarborough has been a rising star in the fastener industry,
              involved in many industry organizations, including the Fastener
              Training Institute. He is currently the Chairman of the
              Southwestern Fastener Association.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his new role, Yarborough will be leading the manufacturing and
              sales of rubber gaskets for the waterworks industry. His strong
              leadership skills and proven track record of success are valuable
              assets that will allow Champion to experience strong, sustaining
              growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yarborough and his team will be working closely with Birmingham
              Fastener to supply American-made products to the waterworks
              industry. Both Champion and Birmingham Fastener have grown their
              businesses around the waterworks industry since the 1980s. With
              the acquisition of Champion, the two companies strengthen their
              manufacturing diversity and product offering to better serve their
              customers.

              “I am so pleased to be joining the Birmingham Fastener family and
              joining the ranks of so many industry rockstars,” says Yarborough,
              “Champion has a proven track record of producing high quality
              gasket for many industries and we are all very excited for the
              opportunity to expand upon that legacy.”
